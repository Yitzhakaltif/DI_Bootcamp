			<h1 id="text">THOR ODINSON</h1>
			<p>
				"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the
				Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of
				Asgard, the Realm Eternal. Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and
				king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and
				became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer
				Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the
				mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible and
				impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard (more
				commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named
				Donald Blake, stripped of his memory. After learning humility he
				regained his memory as well as his godly powers. Thor went on to
				become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members
				of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
